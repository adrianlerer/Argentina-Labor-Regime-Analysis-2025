## About This Paper

This is the **official manuscript** for SSRN publication. It applies the **IusMorfos framework** (previously developed in Lerer 2025a-f) to analyze Argentina's labor market as a case study of irreversible institutional morphology.

### Framework: IusMorfos

**IusMorfos** analyzes constitutional law as **extended phenotype**, where legal regimes exhibit phenotypic expression of underlying constitutional architecture. Institutional lock-in represents **morphological irreversibility** at the constitutional level.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Phenotypic Expression**: Legal regimes as observable manifestations of constitutional genotype
- **Institutional Morphology**: Structural characteristics of legal systems that resist change
- **Irreversibility**: Mathematical convergence to maximum rigidity attractor (Lyapunov stability)
- **Extended Phenotype**: Constitutional provisions create effects beyond immediate legal text (Dawkins 1982 analogy)

### This Paper's Contribution

Demonstrates that Argentina's labor regime exhibits **irreversible institutional morphology** due to:

1. **Constitutional Architecture Lock-in**: Vague Art. 14 bis → Unbounded judicial discretion
2. **Treaty Hierarchy Lock-in**: Art. 75 inc. 22 → ILO conventions at constitutional level
3. **Judicial Doctrine Lock-in**: "Derechos adquiridos" absolutism → Non-regression principle
4. **Federal Fragmentation Lock-in**: 24 provincial courts → Multi-veto system

**Empirical Validation**: 23 reform attempts (1991-2025), 0% success rate, average reversal time = 18.3 months

**Mathematical Proof**: Lyapunov stability analysis shows system converges to maximum rigidity (V̇ < 0 globally)

**Comparative Analysis**: Brazil (CLI=0.34), Spain (0.42), Chile (0.12) exhibit reformable morphology vs. Argentina (CLI=0.87)
